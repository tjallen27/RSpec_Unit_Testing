# Another RSpec test...
This project is to practice RSpec

### Testing notes:
* '.' -> referring to class method names
* '#' -> referring to instance method names

### What I Did/Found:
* "< ApplicationRecord" in the model prevented tests from running: "unitialized constant"
* Write smaller tests
* Test specific methods are performing
